# AirConditionerControl
This is an electro-mechanical adaptor to make use of the existing control panel of the air conditioning appliance. The ON/OFF commands are transferred from the Internet to two stepper motors to actually execute the "push" on each of the two buttons. It uses a nodeMCU board, two TB6612 breakout boards and two small stepper motors.
