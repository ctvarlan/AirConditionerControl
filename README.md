# AirConditionerControl
This is an electro-mechanical adaptor to make use of the existing control panel of the air conditioning appliance. The ON/OFF commands are transferred from the Internet, or from the local two pushbuttons, to two stepper motors which actually execute the "push" on AC panel. 
It makes use of a nodeMCU board, two TB6612 breakout boards and two small stepper motors.
